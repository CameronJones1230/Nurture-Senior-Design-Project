senior design contributions for the week:
look at sensors and take some notes



what we need:
temperature
humidity
light level
ph
these should be relatively easy to find sensors for

for sun use an "ambient UV" sensor. they're super cheap. like this: https://www.adafruit.com/product/4831
try to buy whole packages,ideally with coms built in.
I dont want to have to fab custom pcbs and write drivers and whatnot for this shit.
check adafruit, they ususally have stuff like that

though if we need to do it once we may as well do it for everything I guess?
would make it prettier but SO MUCH MORE WORK and we are't super limited on space here.
check for different package options for maximum prettyness
can solder everything to one big board if you want it to be better or whatever. those are later problems.

macronutrients:
nitrogen
phosphorus
potassium
calcium*
magnesium*
sulfur*

*might not be able to find. looking like they're a bit more involved to test for and we can't exactly replicate lab conditions here.
no spectroscopy

Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium detections loks fairly straightforward. can get that ability in a single package

calcium seems pretty complex, Im not seeing standalone sensors for it, 
from skipping a research paper they used an array of a bunch of different sensors to get data. Would like to avoid that.
paper: https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Soil-calcium-and-pH-monitoring-sensor-system.-Lemos-Nogueira/d5fa68c17f996e30b84ee23f741f31387157925d

magnesium seems to be similar, need to do labratory tests, no sensors easily available

same with sulfur. Some of these are suggesting spectroscopy which is far beyond what we can do 


need to detect all of these somehow, 
really REALLY hoping we dont need to make a fucking robot to 
physically take samples and mix solutions and whatnot

soil sensor, ~$100, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, PH

thermometer is easy, might want to use several. get air and soil temps
maybe at a few different depths?

this example basically stitches abunch of 3rd party sensors together with modbus
modbus is probably a good option to use. can just get a pi hat for modbus and tons of stuff supports is
Id like to keep everything to a single protocol for simplicity sake. CAN would work too but I've never worked with that
either would let us work with rs485 for communications, which would be another win in simplicity.

for Pi we will need to make a custom case, weatherproof, suitable for outdoors use at bare minimum.

I really hate reading research papers, especially in fields Im not in.

comms:
it already has built in wifi module, can get modbus hat or whatever protocol we decide on
processing all the input might be a pain but we should only need to ensure our data is accurate locally 
and do heavy lifting analysis stuff on the remote server


******************************
I think getting accurate data from the sensors is going to be one of the biggest challenges with this. 
I've never attempted to coordinate this many sensors, 
and even with only a couple there are always major problems with accuracy and consistency.
Need to make sure sensors are decent quality
******************************


Do we try to make a custom board for this? while it would be fun Id like to avoid custom PCB fab just casue getting everything to behave 
in a fully custom environment sounds like a nightmare. Lets use premade packages as much as possible, not try to make custom shit.

Im picturing something like a little box we can strap to the side of a pot, plug it into a wall, should only need wifi for external coms,
with several probes on cables we can run into the soil and arrange however we like. 
SUpportive sensors like temp, sunlight, humidity, etc can all be built into the main casing along with the main board


for software we might want to incorperate a location, using USDA hardiness zones to determine what plants can grow outdoors where
all this would need to be done throught the phone app, which would probably be a huge pain. we would also need some kind of plant database 
for track what can be grown where. Or if this is indoors we dont have to care. Only worry about local environment sensors.

So break sensors into two packages: ambient local environment and in-soil
ambient on the main chassis, soil on cable leads
all of this needs to be weather proofed.

ambient:
sunlight
air humidity
temperature

soil:
temperature
moisture
ph
nutrients


might want several of some to ensure accuracy or take averages or whatnot
